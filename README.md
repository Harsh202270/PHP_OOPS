# PHP Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)

This repository is a complete collection of PHP Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice files created during my learning journey.  
It contains all the concepts I learned while understanding how OOP works in PHP, with small and easy-to-understand examples.

This project is purely for **learning, practice, and skill development**.
